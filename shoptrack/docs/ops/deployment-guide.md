# [ShopTrack Documentation](../): Deployment Guide

This document describes how to install, configure, and run the ShopTrack application in a local development environment.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before deploying ShopTrack, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)
- **curl** or **Postman** (optional, for testing API endpoints)

Recommended (but optional):

- **Virtualenv** or **venv** for environment isolation

## 2. Cloning the Repository

Clone the ShopTrack repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewketter/technical-writing-examples/tree/main
cd shoptrack
```

## 3. Setting Up the Environment

Use venv (recommended) to create a virtual environment.

### Mac OS X & Linux

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### On Windows

```
venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all necessary Python packages, including Flask.

## 4. Running the Application

Start the Flask development server:
```
python src/app.py
```

By default, the server will run at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

You should see output similar to:

```shell
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## 5. Testing the Application

You can manually validate functionality by using:

- Web browser (for GET endpoints)
- curl commands
- Postman or similar API clients

Refer to the [Manual API and App  Validation](../validation/api_validation.md)  for a full testing guide.

## 6. Project Structure Overview

```

## 7. Notes

- Development Mode: ShopTrack currently runs in debug mode (debug=True) for easier local development.
- Persistence: All data is in-memory and resets when the server restarts.
- Security: No authentication is implemented in v1.0; all endpoints are public.

## Future Enhancements (Deployment)

Future production deployments may include:

- Docker containerization
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Gunicorn or uWSGI production WSGI servers
- Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Cloud hosting (AWS, Azure, GCP)

## Support

For questions or issues during deployment, please open an issue in the ShopTrack GitHub repository.
